# Tests\Pester\Invoke-Validation.ps1
# COM5411 Generic Pester Test Handler (Deterministic repo root + data injection)
#
# STUDENT NOTE: This is the test harness - YOU DON'T NEED TO EDIT THIS FILE!
# This script automatically:
#   - Discovers all *.Tests.ps1 files in Tests\Pester\
#   - Injects $RepoRoot and $EvidenceDir into your test files
#   - Runs tests and saves results to Evidence\Pester\
#
# USAGE (from repo root):
#   .\Tests\Pester\Invoke-Validation.ps1                    # Run ALL tests
#   .\Tests\Pester\Invoke-Validation.ps1 Preflight*.Tests.ps1  # Run specific test
#   .\Tests\Pester\Invoke-Validation.ps1 -Output Normal     # Less verbose output
#   .\Tests\Pester\Invoke-Validation.ps1 -NoResultFile      # Don't save XML evidence
#
# WHAT YOU GET FOR FREE:
#   - $RepoRoot automatically calculated and injected into your tests
#   - $EvidenceDir path provided (where to save test evidence)
#   - XML results auto-saved for Git commits (Evidence\Pester\PesterResults_*.xml)
